        "After being traded for a fourth round pick from the Miami Dolphins to the Tennessee Titans in the midst of 2019 free agency, Ryan Tannehill joined a Titans team in the backup role to 5th year Marcus Mariota. After starting the season a mere 2-4, it was Tannehill's opportunity to jumpstart a struggling Tennessee offense with a first year offensive coordinator. Over the remaining 10 games, Tannehill led the Titans to a 7-3 record with key wins over the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans, leading them back to NFL Playoffs. The Tannehill led Titans finished within the top 10 scoring offenses in the league, and Tannehill led the league in both yards per attempt and qb rating while also finishing third best in completion percentage.

        "  During the Titan's playoff push, more than Titan's fans began to take notice of Tannehill. The 31 year old small market quarterback began to catch the eyes of many Fantasy Football team owners, as well. According to Tristan Crockett of ESPN, \"Quarterback Ryan Tannehill and wide receiver A.J. Brown of the Tennessee Titans found themselves on a finalist's roster in 27.9% and 33.7% of ESPN leagues, the duo ranking among the five players who have seen the greatest such increase compared with their percentages of playoff qualifiers. Tannehill was on only 10.0% and Brown 9.8% of playoff teams, underscoring how important they have been on the add/drop front.\" "

        "Crockett writes, \"Tannehill and Brown's 51.7 fantasy points in Weeks 14-15 combined were fourth-most among quarterbacks, and Brown's 59.0 PPR fantasy points were second-most behind only Thomas'.\" The emergence of Ryan Tannehill proved to be one of the defining moves in Fantasy leagues as both Tannehill's and AJ Browns average draft position was undrafted. Whichever owner decided he was at least worth a bench spot, was likely gearing up for their championship in week 16(like me). In a season where several QB's saw significant injuries (Ben Roelthisberger, Cam Newton, etc.) acquiring Tannehill off your league's waiver wire may have proved one of the best decisions of your season. As the Fantasy Footballers always say, leagues are won on the waiver wire, not at the draft. "

However, this analysis serves to investigate how goood Tannehill really was, how he elevated the team, and if this production is sustainable."
